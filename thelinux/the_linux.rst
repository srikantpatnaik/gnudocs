Introduction to GNU
-------------------

**GNU** is an Unix-like computer operating system. "GNU" is pronounced g'noo.
GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!". It was publicly announced by
Dr. Richard Stallman on January 5, 1984. 

The goal was to bring a wholly free software operating system into existence. [#]_


GNU project outlines 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, 
you should think of “free” as in "free speech", not as in "free stuff".

Free software is a matter of the users freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,
change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of 
freedom, for the users of the software:

#. The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
#. The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs 
   (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
#. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
#. The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the 
   public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the 
   source code is a precondition for this. 

The Hurd, GNU's own kernel [#]_, is some way from being ready for daily use. Thus,
GNU is typically used today with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the
GNU/Linux operating system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it 
"Linux" by mistake. [#]_

The Linux kernel -1991
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Linux kernel was initially started by Linus Torvalds. Linux rapidly 
accumulated developers and users who adapted code from other free software 
projects for use with the new operating system. The Linux kernel has received 
contributions from thousands of programmers. [#]_

Today, Linux kernel runs super-computers, servers, mobiles, tablets, TVs, set-top
boxes and many consumer electronics.

Migrating from another OS
-------------------------

This is the one decision you will never regret. 


Things to take care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. The most important thing is to have a **backup** of your critical data. I 
   usually put all my important stuff on cloud storage. 

#. It is always encouraged to have a fresh installation, though if you want dual
   boot, then please ensure an empty drive. Note down its exact size too. 

#. Note down your network and proxy settings if any. 

Freeing space for GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. A typical installation needs around 5GB of disk space. But it is strongly
   recommended to have at least 10GB. 

#. A separate SWAP partition is recommended. Linux divides its physical RAM 
   (random access memory) into chunks of memory called pages. Swapping is the 
   process whereby a page of memory is copied to the preconfigured space on 
   the hard disk, called swap space, to free up that page of memory. 


GNU/Linux distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike other operating systems, GNU/Linux doesn't have only one flavor. In fact, 
there are more than thousand variants available. The most popular are listed 
in `distrowatch.com <http://distrowatch.com>`_. You may also be interested in 
the `Linux_distributions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>`_ 
wikipedia page. This page showcase the history and development of popular 
GNU/Linux distributions.

We will be using **Ubuntu** for rest of the discussion. The only reason for 
Ubuntu is its popularity and support. There are many distributions which
are arguably more productive than Ubuntu. 

Ubuntu is based on one of the oldest distribution **Debian**. There are many 
variants of Debian too, Ubuntu is most favoured by beginners. 

On the other hand there are many sub-distributions of Ubuntu too. LinuxMint is
most popular among them. 

In fact, anyone with good understanding of internals of GNU/Linux , 
can either customize or start his own distribution. More comprehensive details
are available at `linuxfromscratch.org <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/>`_
